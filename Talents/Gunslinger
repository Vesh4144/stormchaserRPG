# Gunslinger Talent Tree
With an aim as sharp as their wit, gunslingers pursue their own ends for their own reasons, beholden to no code except their own, and trusting no judgment save that learned through experience. The wild frontier breeds hard folk to hard ways, a dangerous land where life can hinge on a deal of the cards or the speed of the draw.

### Deadeye

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
*In combat, you find your flow with deadly efficiency.*

Whenever you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, the lowest number you must roll on the d20 to score a critical hit with subsequent ranged weapon attacks decreases by one. You can gain this benefit multiple times, but it can’t reduce the threshold for scoring a critical hit below 16.

You lose this benefit if you miss with an attack, you become incapacitated, or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a creature since your last turn.

### Bad Medicine

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a firearm.

The number of additional dice increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Bad Medicine column of the Gunslinger table.

### Combat Superiority

You learn two [maneuvers](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Fighter/Maneuvers/) of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You may only use one maneuver per turn.

As a fighter gains talents, they learn to use their combat superiority in new ways. When you take your 3rd fighter talent, you also learn a new [maneuver](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Fighter/Maneuvers/). You learn an additional [maneuver](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Fighter/Maneuvers/) for every second fighter talent taken after the 3rd.

Each time that you learn a new [maneuver](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Fighter/Maneuvers/), you can also replace one maneuver that you know with a different one.
